In this episode of the Tammy Peterson Podcast, we explore faith in public life, spiritual heritage in the UK, and the transformative power of motherhood and prayer. I sit down with Kam Flynn, a devoted wife, mother, and civil servant in the UK government with over two decades of experience in policy and efficiency. Kam shares how her journey from apartheid-era South Africa to Westminster leadership has been shaped by her deep Christian faith, her mother\u2019s legacy, and a calling to unify believers through national prayer. We discuss the creation of the UK\u2019s first National Week of Prayer, her work reforming education systems in South Africa, and what it means to listen for God\u2019s voice when making life-altering decisions. Kam\u2019s story is one of courage, clarity, and conviction.

It's important to note that 'Osteopath' is a trademarked title for American D.O.s, while in Canada, we are recognized as Osteopathic Manual Practitioners. Candice Nesrallah is an Osteopathic Manual Practitioner. Additionally, the term 'diagnose' falls outside the scope of practice for Canadian Osteopathic Manual Practitioners and was used here solely to describe findings in the context of this podcast.\n\nThis episode was recorded on January 10th, 2025.\n\nCandice Nesrallah is a renowned Osteopathic Manual Practitioner based in Toronto. She launched her career in 2005 by attending Sutherland Chan Massage Therapy College, graduating in 2007 as a registered massage therapist (RMT). Furthering her expertise, Nesrallah pursued the Contemporary Medical Acupuncture course at McMaster in 2012 and enrolled at the Canadian College of Osteopathy in 2013. In 2015, she reached a significant career milestone by opening her own clinic in downtown Toronto. After a rigorous 7-year, 4,370-hour program, Nesrallah graduated as an Osteopathic Manual Practitioner in 2021, defending her dissertation successfully. Currently, she operates a thriving home-based clinic in Toronto, dedicating her time to full-time osteopathic practice.\n\nFind more from Candice:\nCandice Nesrallah: https://candicenesrallah.com\nInstagram: https://instragram.com/candicenesrallahosteopathy\n\nConnect with me: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tammy.m.peterson\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TammyPetersonPodcast\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@tammypetersonpodcast\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tammy1Peterson\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/TammyPetersonPodcast", "publishedAt": "2025-03-06T18:00:26Z", "videoId": "bAWl0QogvlU", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bAWl0QogvlU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bAWl0QogvlU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bAWl0QogvlU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bAWl0QogvlU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bAWl0QogvlU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channel": "Tammy Peterson"}, {"title": "What is prayer?

McMahon, MD, founder of Whole World Healthcare has been practicing pediatrics in Roswell, New Mexico, for 26 years. His interest in Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) began in 2009. Dr. McMahon first learned about CIRS after being approached by a businessman whose daughter became ill while attending a local school. The search for this child\u2019s healing led him to Dr. Richie Shoemaker, the global expert on mold illnesses. McMahon visited Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s practice to learn about the treatment for CIRS and saw the tremendous need for more physicians prepared to treat CIRS. He immediately opened a practice in Roswell specifically to diagnose and treat patients with CIRS, starting with 15 patients from the local school. His CIRS practice has now grown and he has seen thousands of adults and children to date.\n\nFor more information about Dr. Scott and CIRS:\nFor more information about Dr. Scott McMahon, visit ScottMcMahon.doctor\nFor information about Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS), visit www.CIRSx.com\n\nFollow Dr. Scott on Social Media:\nFollow me on Instagram at @DrScottMaMahon\nFriend me on Facebook at www.facebook.com/drscottmcmahon\nConnect with me on LinkedIn at www.linkedin.com/in/dr-scott-mcmahon-834b1337/\nTune in to Medicine and Miracles: Visit MedicineAndMiracle.com\nNow on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2sVyiAXZUHO47vjd6P9p2L?si=ZTM3A9waRtiU8oIxonC9Gg\nNow on iHeartRadio: https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1323-medicine-and-miracles-pod-227401401/\nNow on Amazon Podcasts: https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/d3ad93e6-f49f-405a-b694-19fda78dad63/medicine-and-miracles-podcast\n\nConnect with me: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tammy.m.peterson\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TammyPetersonPodcast\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@tammypetersonpodcast\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tammy1Peterson\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/TammyPetersonPodcast", "publishedAt": "2025-02-06T00:00:06Z", "videoId": "65cIsb_XE1U", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/65cIsb_XE1U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/65cIsb_XE1U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/65cIsb_XE1U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/65cIsb_XE1U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/65cIsb_XE1U/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channel": "Tammy Peterson"}, {"title": "God\u2019s plan is a mystery, but His mercy and love are undeniable. \u271d\ufe0f\ud83d\udc99", "description": "#Faith #SovereignGod #grace", "publishedAt": "2025-01-31T20:00:05Z", "videoId": "Akdwixeakfo", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Akdwixeakfo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Akdwixeakfo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Akdwixeakfo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Akdwixeakfo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Akdwixeakfo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channel": "Tammy Peterson"}, {"title": "Strong churches shape strong societies\u2014belong before you believe.", "description": "#christianity   #faithandsociety   #churchcommunity", "publishedAt": "2025-01-30T20:00:25Z", "videoId": "pY7fz4FX7N8", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pY7fz4FX7N8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pY7fz4FX7N8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pY7fz4FX7N8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pY7fz4FX7N8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pY7fz4FX7N8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channel": "Tammy Peterson"}, {"title": "From rebellion to redemption\u2014God's love transformed Him", "description": "#christianity  #faithjourney  #spiritualawakening", "publishedAt": "2025-01-30T00:00:07Z", "videoId": "B9DC5TMuhPg", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B9DC5TMuhPg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B9DC5TMuhPg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B9DC5TMuhPg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B9DC5TMuhPg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B9DC5TMuhPg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channel": "Tammy Peterson"}, {"title": "Why The Church Is Coming Back To Transforming Society | Jamie Corcoran | EP 141", "description": "This episode was recorded on October 29th, 2024. \n\nJamie, married to his teenage sweetheart Ludmila for 19 years with four boys, is the founding and Lead Pastor of Lighthouse Church based in Dublin, Ireland.

In 1971, she opened the world\u2019s first women\u2019s refuge in Chiswick, London, and later established numerous shelters during the 1970s and 1980s. Erin became well-known for her court battles over overcrowded refuges and her appearances on top chat shows, earning a reputation as a crusader for the destitute. Her advocacy extended to squatting in properties to provide shelter. Erin brought domestic violence to public attention, compelling authorities to address the issue. She moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in the 1980s after receiving death threats for highlighting female-perpetrated abuse, as detailed in her book \"Prone to Violence.\" She returned to London in 1997 and advocated for male abuse victims, becoming a patron of ManKind Initiative and Families Need Fathers. In 2013, Erin joined the advisory board of A Voice for Men and appeared in the 2016 documentary \"The Red Pill.\" In 2023, she was featured in \"Erin: Beyond the Bruises.\" Erin authored several cult classics, including \"Scream Quietly or the Neighbours Will Hear\" and \"This Way to the Revolution: A Memoir.\" She believes domestic abuse is generational and not gender-specific, advocating for multi-generational therapy to break the cycle of violence.\n\nFind more from Erin:\nErin in Cassie Jaye\u2019s landmark documentary The Red Pill:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irVB8b0zhQI\nWhy I loathe feminism by Erin Pizzey:\u00a0https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1215464/Why-I-loathe-feminism---believe-ultimately-destroy-family.html\nErin Pizzey documentary:\u00a0http://film-directory.britishcouncil.org/erin-beyond-the-bruises\nErin on family dynamics / the breakdown of the family:\u00a0https://youtu.be/53Gmx_wfft8\nDocumentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7F4GFHI2oY\n\nConnect with me: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tammy.m.peterson\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TammyPetersonPodcast\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@tammypetersonpodcast\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tammy1Peterson\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/TammyPetersonPodcast\n\n\u2014 Chapters \u2014\n00:00 - Coming Up\n02:11 - Introduction\n04:21 - My Father Was a Bully\n07:54 - My Parents' Captivity Under Mao\n09:44 - My Influential Mentor\n14:05 - Founding Chiswick Women\u2019s Aid\n19:39 - Understanding Abuse as an Addiction\n24:10 - Courage Rooted in Faith\n27:14 - The Stigma of Domestic Violence\n35:48 - The Impact of Marxism\n41:17 - Healing the Wounds of Boyhood\n43:51 - Navigating Therapeutic Chaos\n45:22 - The Courts' Deaf Ears\n49:12 - The Gender Divide\n51:28 - Honored as a Companion of the British Empire\n54:33 - Confronting The Shining Path\n59:01 - From Frustration to Rage\n01:01:20 - The Complexity of Human Relationships\n01:03:33 - Reflections on the Feminist Movement\n01:08:30 - Finding the Strength to Stand Alone", "publishedAt": "2024-07-12T18:00:13Z", "videoId": "HnTYsdjCW-c", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HnTYsdjCW-c/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HnTYsdjCW-c/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HnTYsdjCW-c/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HnTYsdjCW-c/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HnTYsdjCW-c/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channel": "Tammy Peterson"}, {"title": "The struggle for free speech amidst deep-rooted ideologies.", "description": "", "publishedAt": "2024-07-10T18:00:27Z", "videoId": "ZojCu_F98u8", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZojCu_F98u8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZojCu_F98u8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZojCu_F98u8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZojCu_F98u8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZojCu_F98u8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channel": "Tammy Peterson"}, {"title": "Trust and Faith in Politics | Alex Vanopslagh | EP 94", "description": "This episode was recorded on December 19th, 2023.\n\nBorn in 1991, Alex has been the leader of the Liberal Alliance since 2019.

We discuss the detrimental impact of feminism on the perception of womanhood, the critical role of balancing masculinity and femininity within society, and the profound influence of community and technology on youth today.

He advocates for the belief that children should embrace their true selves without being swayed by the notion that they were born in the wrong body. Highlighting the controversial use of puberty blockers as a preliminary step in a medical process  brings more harm than good, he sheds light on the misinformation surrounding these drugs and the subsequent cross-sex hormones. Drawing attention to a significant ruling by the High Court in England, he emphasizes that children are incapable of giving informed consent to these life-changing medications. Faced with a lack of action from politicians and a silence from the media, he has taken it upon himself to spark dialogue across North America, one conversation at a time, striving to make a difference in how society approaches this delicate subject.

He has been independently studying biblical Hebrew since the age of 16 and eventually continued within the department of religious studies at McGill University, where he majored in Mathematics and Computer Science.\n\nMattieu\u2019s book, The Language of Creation: \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Language-Creation-Symbolism-Genesis-Commentary/dp/1981549331\n\nConnect with me: \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tammy.m.peterson/\nFaceboook: https://www.facebook.com/MrsTammyMPeterson\n\n\u2014 Chapters \u2014\n\n[00:00] - Intro\n[02:51] - Introduction to Mattieu Pageau\n[05:50] - Mattieu's future writing plans\n[07:37] - The Bible isn\u2019t about morality\n[13:56] - Learning from historical stories\n[21:13] - Mattieu\u2019s interpretation of the Bible\n[26:20] - Tammy\u2019s experience in the hospital\n[29:06] - The experience of losing control\n[31:36] - Discovering meaning at a young age\n[34:56] - The current climate of our secular society\n[36:24] - Understanding the simple truths over the complexities\n[38:21] - The removal of sin from society\n[41:57] - The importance of taking care of your needs\n[45:48] - We often do not know what we want\n[49:50] - The meaning of unleavened bread\n[56:44] - The symbolic meaning of the sacrifice of an animal", "publishedAt": "2022-10-08T15:26:35Z", "videoId": "7Om4NKrOCF4", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Om4NKrOCF4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Om4NKrOCF4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Om4NKrOCF4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Om4NKrOCF4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Om4NKrOCF4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channel": "Tammy Peterson"}, {"title": "Wyatt Melton advocates for awareness of positive treatments for athletes.", "description": "", "publishedAt": "2022-09-16T19:00:12Z", "videoId": "Swshwg7Vajs", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Swshwg7Vajs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Swshwg7Vajs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Swshwg7Vajs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Swshwg7Vajs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Swshwg7Vajs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channel": "Tammy Peterson"}, {"title": "Tammy Peterson on the Healing Ability of Laser Therapy | Tammy Peterson, Slava Kim & Wyatt Melton", "description": "Watch the full episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RzzwcmJYiQ\n\nI\u2019m this episode, Tammy speaks with two guests\u2014Wyatt Melton and Slava Kim.
